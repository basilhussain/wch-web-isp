# WCH RISC-V Microcontroller Web Serial ISP

This is a serial ISP flashing tool for WCH RISC-V microcontrollers that runs in a web browser. Entirely self-contained, with no additional software, libraries, or drivers required.

It uses the JavaScript [Web Serial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SerialPort) browser API, and so requires support for this feature by the browser. At time of writing, only the following browsers feature support for the Web Serial API: Chrome version 89+, Edge version 89+, Opera version 76+. This tool does not work in FireFox and Safari, due to lack of support for the API.

> **You can find a hosted version of this tool on my website, at: [https://www.stasisleak.uk/wchisp/](https://www.stasisleak.uk/wchisp/).**
