# WCH RISC-V Microcontroller Web Serial ISP

This is a serial ISP flashing tool for WCH RISC-V microcontrollers that runs in a web browser. Entirely self-contained, with no additional software, libraries, or drivers required.

It uses the JavaScript [Web Serial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SerialPort) browser API, and so requires support for this feature by the browser. At time of writing, only the following browsers feature support for the Web Serial API: Chrome version 89+, Edge version 89+, Opera version 76+. This tool does not work in FireFox and Safari, due to lack of support for the API.

## Building

> [!NOTE]
> **A pre-built copy can be found in the Releases section of the GitHub repository.**

Building requires the bundling tool [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), a copy of which needs be installed in a `tools\esbuild` sub-folder of the project. Please note building is currently only supported on Windows.

To build:

1. Open a command prompt in the project folder.
2. Run `build.bat`.
3. The resultant HTML, JS, and CSS files will be output to the `dist` sub-folder.

If any Linux/Mac users are feeling resourceful, they may wish to review the contents of `build.bat` and translate the script within to an appropriate shell script or discrete commands. ðŸ˜„

## Running

If you downloaded a pre-built release, first extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice.

Open in your web browser the `index.html` file from the `dist` folder.

If you want to deploy a copy of this tool to be hosted on your own web server, simply upload all files within the `dist` folder to a location of your choice on your web server.
